Dispatcher: 911, what’s your emergency?

Caller: I—I think something’s wrong. I’m feeling really weird, and I can’t move my right side. My face feels numb.

Dispatcher: I’m sorry to hear that. I’m going to help you. What’s your name, and where are you right now?

Caller: My name is Linda. I’m at 450 Birch Lane, Apartment 6C.

Dispatcher: Thank you, Linda. Help is on the way. I’m going to ask you some questions to help the paramedics. When did this start happening?

Caller: Maybe ten minutes ago? I—I was just sitting down, and suddenly, I couldn’t talk properly or lift my arm.

Dispatcher: I understand, Linda. It sounds like you’re experiencing stroke symptoms, but you’re doing the right thing by calling. Are you alone, or is anyone with you?

Caller: I’m alone. I’m trying to talk, but my words are coming out slurred.

Dispatcher: That’s okay, Linda. Just try to stay calm. Can you smile for me? Does one side of your face droop?

Caller: Yeah, my left side is fine, but my right side feels heavy. I can’t smile properly.

Dispatcher: Thank you for checking that. Are you able to lift both of your arms, or is one side weaker?

Caller: I can lift my left arm, but my right arm won’t move. It’s like it’s numb.

Dispatcher: Okay, Linda. Help is on the way, and they’re going to be there very soon. Do you have any history of strokes, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions?

Caller: I have high blood pressure, but I take meds for it. I’ve never had a stroke before.

Dispatcher: Thanks for letting me know. Keep taking slow, deep breaths. You’re doing a great job. Try to stay as still as you can until the paramedics arrive.

Caller: I’m really scared. It’s getting hard to talk.

Dispatcher: I know, Linda. This is scary, but you’re doing exactly what you need to do. Just keep calm and stay with me. Help is almost there.

Caller: Okay. My heart’s racing, and I feel like I’m going to pass out.

Dispatcher: Try to stay focused on your breathing, Linda. The paramedics are close. Do you hear them yet?

Caller: I think I hear sirens now.

Dispatcher: That’s them. They’ll be with you in just a moment. You’re doing great. Just hang on.

Caller: I see them coming to my door now.

Dispatcher: That’s good, Linda. They’re going to take care of you from here. You’re in good hands.

Caller: Thank you so much.

Dispatcher: You’re welcome, Linda. Stay strong—you’re going to be okay.
