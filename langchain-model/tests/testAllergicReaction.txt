Dispatcher: 911, what’s your emergency?

Caller: Hi, I—I think I’m having an allergic reaction. My throat feels tight, and I’m breaking out in hives.

Dispatcher: I’m sorry to hear that. I’m going to help you. What’s your name and location?

Caller: It’s Mark. I’m at 1127 Pine Avenue, Apartment 2A.

Dispatcher: Thanks, Mark. Help is on the way. I need to ask you a few questions. How long ago did this start?

Caller: About ten minutes ago. I just had some food, and then my throat started feeling weird. Now it’s hard to swallow, and my lips are swelling.

Dispatcher: Do you know what you might be allergic to?

Caller: Yeah, I’m allergic to peanuts. I thought the food was safe, but maybe I messed up.

Dispatcher: Thanks for telling me, Mark. Are you having any trouble breathing, or are you feeling dizzy or lightheaded?

Caller: Yeah, it’s hard to breathe. I’m getting lightheaded too, like I might pass out.

Dispatcher: I need you to stay as calm as possible. Do you have an EpiPen with you?

Caller: Yeah, I do, but I’m freaking out and don’t know if I should use it.

Dispatcher: You’re doing great, Mark. It’s important to use the EpiPen if you’re having trouble breathing. Can you get it now?

Caller: Okay, yeah, I’ve got it.

Dispatcher: Good. Take the cap off, and inject it into your thigh—right through your clothing if you need to. You should hear a click.

Caller: Okay, I just did it. I’m still scared.

Dispatcher: You did great. The medicine will help, but it might take a few minutes. Keep breathing slowly. Paramedics are on their way, and they’ll be there shortly.

Caller: My throat still feels tight. I’m trying to stay calm, but it’s hard.

Dispatcher: I know it’s tough, Mark, but you’re doing exactly what you need to do. Just keep breathing. Is there anyone else there with you?

Caller: No, I’m alone. I feel a little better, but I’m still scared.

Dispatcher: That’s completely normal. You’re doing everything right. If you start feeling worse or faint, try to stay on the line with me, okay?

Caller: Okay. I think I hear them now.

Dispatcher: That’s great, Mark. The paramedics are there to help you. They’re going to take good care of you. Stay on the line until they get to you, okay?

Caller: Okay, thank you. I see them at the door now.

Dispatcher: You’re welcome, Mark. You’re in safe hands. They’ll handle everything from here.

Caller: Thank you so much.

Dispatcher: You’re welcome, Mark. You did great. Take care
