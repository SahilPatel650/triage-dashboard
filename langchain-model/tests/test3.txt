Dispatcher: 911, what’s your emergency?

Caller: I… I just burned myself really badly. It’s on my arm. It hurts so much!

Dispatcher: I’m sorry to hear that. I’m here to help. Where are you located?

Caller: I’m at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 4B.

Dispatcher: Got it. Help is on the way. Can you tell me what caused the burn?

Caller: I accidentally spilled boiling water on my arm. It’s all red, and some of the skin looks blistered.

Dispatcher: Okay, I need you to stay calm. Do you have any cold water nearby?

Caller: Yes, I’m near the sink.

Dispatcher: Good. Run cool—not ice-cold—water over the burn for at least 10 minutes. Don’t put any creams or ointments on it. Are you alone?

Caller: No, my friend is here.

Dispatcher: Great, ask them to stay with you until emergency services arrive. Keep the burn elevated if possible, and avoid touching it. The paramedics will be there soon. You’re doing great.

Caller: Okay, thank you. It hurts so much…

Dispatcher: I know it’s painful. Just keep it under the cool water, and help will be there shortly. Stay on the line with me if you need more assistance, alright?

Caller: Okay, I will. Thank you.

Dispatcher: You’re welcome. Help is on the way.
