Caller: I can breathe, but it’s really hard to focus. I’m feeling dizzy too.
Caller: I’m in a lot of pain… my stomach hurts really bad, and I don’t know what’s wrong!
Dispatcher: I understand. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, how would you rate your pain?
Caller: It’s definitely a 9… it’s sharp and feels like it’s spreading.
