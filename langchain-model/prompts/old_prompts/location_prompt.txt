Given the following transcript of a call between a person who is hurt or in danger and a dispatcher, extract the location of the person.
Extracting this information accurately is imperative to making sure first responders can get to the person in a timely matter and save their life.
Here are a couple examples of what to do. Make sure to format the address exactly as following:

House/Building number, Street name, Apartment or Unit number, City, State, Zip/Postal Code

If any values of the date field are not provided, fill them in with the placeholder. For example if the state is not given, write "state" in its place.

Examples:
<example>

123, Maple Street, Apartment 4B, City, State, Zip
