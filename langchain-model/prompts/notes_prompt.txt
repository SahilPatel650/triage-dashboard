Dispatcher: 911, what’s your emergency?
Caller: I’m in a lot of pain… my stomach hurts really bad, and I don’t know what’s wrong!
Dispatcher: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me your name and location?
Caller: My name is Sarah Collins. I’m at 789 Willow Street, Riverton, NJ 08077.
Dispatcher: Thank you, Sarah. Help is on the way. I need to ask you some questions to assist you further. How long have you been feeling this pain?
Caller: It started about an hour ago, but it’s getting worse… I can barely move now.
Dispatcher: I understand. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, how would you rate your pain?
Caller: It’s definitely a 9… it’s sharp and feels like it’s spreading.
Dispatcher: Have you eaten anything unusual, or do you have any medical conditions we should know about?
Caller: No, nothing unusual. I don’t have any conditions, but I’m feeling nauseous, and I can’t keep anything down.
Dispatcher: Okay, Sarah. Are you able to breathe normally? Is your vision affected?
Caller: I can breathe, but it’s really hard to focus. I’m feeling dizzy too.
Dispatcher: Stay as still and comfortable as possible. An ambulance is on the way, and they should be there soon. Do you have anyone there with you?
Caller: No, I’m alone…
Dispatcher: Okay, Sarah, you’re doing great. Keep the phone close by, and if anything changes before help arrives, let me know immediately. Just try to stay calm, okay?
Caller: Okay… thank you. Please hurry.
Dispatcher: We’re doing everything we can, Sarah. Help is almost there. You’re going to be okay.
